# Summary
The WeatherPy notebook deploys linear regression and scatterplots to illustrate the relationship between humidity and temperature as latitude changes. We see big picture trends, then seek to make those insights actionable in the next analysis.

VacationPy notebook uses climate data to locate hotels in places that won't get hotter than 80F. This could be used effectively to create leads for international travel or relocation.

# Tech Stack
